      <p> 
        With this application, project managers and group members can keep track of deadlines
        they face when working on their projects. Project managers can invite members into their         project group, add new deadlines, and manage those things that they create. Group members
        can view other projects and the members on those projects, as well as their deadlines. 
        Group members can search for projects and/or deadlines.
